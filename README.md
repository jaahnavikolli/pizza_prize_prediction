This project aims to predict the price of pizza based on various features using machine learning. The dataset provided contains information about different pizzas, including their characteristics and corresponding prices.

Dataset
Filename: pizza.csv
Contents: The dataset includes multiple features that describe pizzas and their prices.
Columns (Assumed):
Size: The size of the pizza (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
Toppings: Number or types of toppings on the pizza.
Crust Type: The type of crust (e.g., Thin, Thick, Stuffed).
Price: The price of the pizza (target variable for prediction).

Usage
Load the dataset
Preprocess the data:
Handle missing values
Convert categorical variables into numerical form
Normalize numerical features if necessary
Train a Machine Learning Model
Use regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to predict the price.

Evaluate the Model
Use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared score to measure model performance.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
technology:Machine Learning

Libraries & Frameworks:
